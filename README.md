# report-pipeline-demo

This project is designed to showcase my abilities in utilizing key data engineering tools such as Kafka, Airflow, and PySpark. It demonstrates a comprehensive data pipeline that integrates these technologies to process and analyze data effectively.

## Overview

The `report-pipeline-demo` project exemplifies a modern data engineering pipeline that includes:

- **Apache Kafka**: For real-time data streaming and message brokering.
- **Apache Airflow**: For orchestrating complex workflows and automating tasks.
- **PySpark**: For large-scale data processing and analytics.

## Components

### Kafka

Kafka is used in this project to produce and consume streaming data. It acts as the backbone for managing the flow of real-time data through the pipeline.

### Airflow

Airflow is employed to schedule and manage the execution of various tasks within the pipeline. It ensures that data flows smoothly between different components and handles dependencies.

### PySpark

PySpark is used for processing and analyzing large datasets. It allows for efficient handling of big data and supports complex data transformations.

## Getting Started

To run this project, you need to have the following prerequisites installed:

- Kafka
- Airflow
- Spark
- Python (with kafka-python and pandas packages)

### Running the Pipeline

1. **Start Kafka and Create Topics**: Ensure Kafka is running and create the necessary topics for data ingestion.
2. **Set Up Airflow**: Place the DAG file in the Airflow DAGs directory and start the Airflow web server and scheduler.
3. **Run PySpark Job**: Execute the PySpark script to process the data streamed from Kafka.

## Conclusion

The `report-pipeline-demo` project is a testament to my skills in designing and implementing data pipelines using state-of-the-art data engineering tools. It demonstrates my ability to work with complex data workflows and provides a foundation for building scalable and efficient data solutions.
